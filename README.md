# HPC Internships
We've compiled a list of companies (and labs, orgs, etc) known to have/have had HPC-oriented internships (and opportunities in general), whether by working with the systems or applications that require HPC. This is a working list, so check back to see if we've (or you've) found any new internships.

Most are available this season, though there are exceptions for record purposes. 

The original document we compiled can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KXSyCtucD6YsH7eFSETqrgGM-VmSRE0ZeBmmocr-9r0/edit?usp=sharing)

Acronyms

If you find any other internships from outside the sheet, feel free to make a pull request or let us know at supercomputing.gt@gmail.com

Inspired by the Pitt CSC's list of internships.
